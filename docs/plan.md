# Landing Page Evolution: AgenticMarkting.work

## Vision
Transform the current placeholder into a high-converting, professional landing page that communicates the power of autonomous marketing pipelines.

## Talking Points & Messaging
- **Core Hook:** "The End of Manual Marketing Operations."
- **Automation:** Automating the entire pipeline from strategy to execution.
- **Sub-Product Ecosystem:** Specialized tools like **Decent Proposal** for end-to-end proposal management.
- **Revenue Tracking:** Close the loop by tracking revenue and new business outcomes directly back to your marketing efforts.
- **Brand Intelligence:** Agents that learn and adapt to your brand voice.
- **Real-time Optimization:** Autonomous adjustment of campaigns based on live data.

## Proposed Page Structure
1.  **Hero Section:** High-impact headline, sub-headline, and primary CTA.
2.  **The "Problem" Section:** Highlight the friction in manual marketing and disjointed sales processes.
3.  **The Agentic Solution:** Introduce specialized agents (The Strategist, The Creator, The Optimizer).
4.  **Product Ecosystem:** Showcase sub-products, starting with [Decent Proposal](https://decentproposal.agenticmarkting.work) (Automation, Sharing, Analytics).
5.  **How it Works:** A simple 3-step visualization of the agentic pipeline.
6.  **Footer:** Simple links, social, and copyright.

## Design Goals
- Maintain the "Atmospheric" aesthetic (Glows, Sora font, clean typography).
- Transition from a single-card layout to a full-page scrollable experience.
- Incorporate subtle animations to simulate "agent activity."

## Roadmap
- [ ] Define final copy for each section.
- [ ] Update `index.html` with new semantic structure.
- [ ] Expand `styles.css` to support full-page sections and better responsive behavior.
- [ ] Enhance `script.js` for interactive elements (reveals, agent status simulations).
- [ ] Finalize Waitlist/CTA integration.
